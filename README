Any ideas or getting evolved into development, free feel to contact my email.

This simple application is to chat by a group of people at real-time together.
The code structure and functions are still developing.
And the server IP and port I have set up in /client/PRM.h

The compile is separated into the client folder and server folder and get "make".
